# Medical-Cost-EDA-Prediction
### **Project Description**

The project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset containing features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region, the goal is to build models that accurately predict healthcare charges and provide meaningful insights into the factors influencing these costs.

The project has two primary objectives:
1. **Regression Analysis:** Estimate healthcare charges as continuous values using regression models.
2. **Classification Task:** Transform the problem into a binary classification to label charges as either "cheap" or "expensive" based on a predefined threshold.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), relationships between features and medical charges are visualized, while identifying and handling outliers to improve model performance. Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks are implemented to solve regression problems, while models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest are applied for classification tasks.

The solution emphasizes rigorous evaluation metrics for both regression (e.g., RÂ², MAE, MSE) and classification (e.g., Precision, Recall, F1-Score). The project concludes by identifying high-performing models and providing actionable insights to enhance predictive accuracy for medical costs in future applications.
